### More Info
 
Ummm... about the menu in the traybar, dont hit stop from VB or it'll stay there for a while and might crash VB. and also, if someone could help me on 4 things, why does it munch so much ram, how do I make the traymenu behave like a normal one, and is there any way using api and VB4 to create a menu on the fly so I don't need a form in my project, and why does attemting to close, say the debug window in vb4/32 with the joystick fail?
